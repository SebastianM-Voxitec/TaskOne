# Articles folder — placeholders for real content

All on-page text is currently driven by placeholders in `../articles.ts`.

To use real articles later:

- Add your article content here (e.g. markdown, JSON, or CMS IDs).
- Update `src/content/articles.ts` to import from this folder or from your CMS instead of using the placeholder strings.

The app will then render real headlines, body copy, and dates in LATEST RESEARCH, RECENT NEWS, and RECENT PARTNERSHIPS.
